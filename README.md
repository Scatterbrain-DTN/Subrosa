# Subrosa
Subrosa is a minimal working example of a scatterbrain client application. It is a usenet-like social networking application with nested user-created discussion groups.

While this example is fully functional, it has minimal features and may not have the same standard of code quality as the actual Scatterbrain router. It is only intended as an example of how the Scatterbrain api can be used in a production application.
